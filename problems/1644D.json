All cells are colored in white initially.q\ud835\udc5e operations have been applied to the sheet. The i\ud835\udc56-th of them can be described as follows:   xi\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 yi\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u00a0\u2014 choose one of k\ud835\udc58 non-white colors and color the entire row xi\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 and the entire column yi\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 in it. The new color is applied to each cell, regardless of whether the cell was colored before the operation. The sheet after applying all q\ud835\udc5e operations is called a coloring. Two colorings are different if there exists at least one cell that is colored in different colors.How many different colorings are there? Print the number modulo 998244353998244353."
