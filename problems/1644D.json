    "history": "There is a sheet of paper that can be represented with a grid of size \ud835\udc5b\u00d7\ud835\udc5an\u00d7m: \ud835\udc5bn rows and \ud835\udc5am columns of cells. All cells are colored in white initially.\ud835\udc5eq operations have been applied to the sheet. The \ud835\udc56i-th of them can be described as follows:   \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56xi \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56yi\u00a0\u2014 choose one of \ud835\udc58k non-white colors and color the entire row \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56xi and the entire column \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56yi in it. The new color is applied to each cell, regardless of whether the cell was colored before the operation. The sheet after applying all \ud835\udc5eq operations is called a coloring. Two colorings are different if there exists at least one cell that is colored in different colors.How many different colorings are there? Print the number modulo 998244353998244353."
