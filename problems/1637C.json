    "input": "The input contains several test cases. The first line contains one integer t (1\u2264t\u226410000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.The first line for each test case contains one integer n (3\u2264n\u2264105)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array.The second line contains a sequence of integers a1,a2,\u2026,an (1\u2264ai\u2264109)\u00a0\u2014 the array elements.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n over all test cases does not exceed 105.",
    "output": "For each test case print the minimum number of operations needed to move stones to piles 1 and n, or print \u22121 if it's impossible.",
    "history": "Andrew has n piles with stones. The i-th pile contains ai stones. He wants to make his table clean so he decided to put every stone either to the 1-st or the n-th pile.Andrew can perform the following operation any number of times: choose 3 indices 1\u2264i<j<k\u2264n, such that the j-th pile contains at least 2 stones, then he takes 2 stones from the pile j and puts one stone into pile i and one stone into pile k. Tell Andrew what is the minimum number of operations needed to move all the stones to piles 1 and n, or determine if it's impossible.",
    "note": "In the first test case, it is optimal to do the following:   Select (i,j,k)=(1,2,5). The array becomes equal to [2,0,2,3,7].  Select (i,j,k)=(1,3,4). The array becomes equal to [3,0,0,4,7].  Twice select (i,j,k)=(1,4,5). The array becomes equal to [5,0,0,0,9]. This array satisfy the statement, because every stone is moved to piles 1 and 5.  There are 4 operations in total.In the second test case, it's impossible to put all stones into piles with numbers 1 and 3:   At the beginning there's only one possible operation with (i,j,k)=(1,2,3). The array becomes equal to [2,1,2].  Now there is no possible operation and the array doesn't satisfy the statement, so the answer is \u22121. In the third test case, it's optimal to do the following:   Select (i,j,k)=(1,2,3). The array becomes equal to [2,0,2]. This array satisfies the statement, because every stone is moved to piles 1 and 3.  The is 1 operation in total.In the fourth test case, it's impossible to do any operation, and the array doesn't satisfy the statement, so the answer is \u22121."
