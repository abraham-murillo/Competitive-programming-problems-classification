    "input": "The first line of input data contains an integer t (1\u2264t\u2264103) \u2014 the number of input test cases.The descriptions of the t cases follow. Each test case is represented by two lines:  string s, which has an odd length from 1 to 49 inclusive and consists of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet;  is a string containing one letter c, where c is a lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. ",
    "output": "For each test case in a separate line output: YES, if the string s can be converted so that s=c is true; NO otherwise. You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).",
    "note": "In the first test case, s=\"abcde\". You need to get s=\"c\". For the first operation, delete the first two letters, we get s=\"cde\". In the second operation, we delete the last two letters, so we get the expected value of s=\"c\".In the third test case, s=\"x\", it is required to get s=\"y\". Obviously, this cannot be done.",
    "history": "The string s is given, the string length is odd number. The string consists of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet.As long as the string length is greater than 1, the following operation can be performed on it: select any two adjacent letters in the string s and delete them from the string. For example, from the string \"lemma\" in one operation, you can get any of the four strings: \"mma\", \"lma\", \"lea\" or \"lem\" In particular, in one operation, the length of the string reduces by 2.Formally, let the string s have the form s=s1s2\u2026sn (n>1). During one operation, you choose an arbitrary index i (1\u2264i<n) and replace s=s1s2\u2026si\u22121si+2\u2026sn.For the given string s and the letter c, determine whether it is possible to make such a sequence of operations that in the end the equality s=c will be true? In other words, is there such a sequence of operations that the process will end with a string of length 1, which consists of the letter c?"
